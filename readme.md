## Hangfire.Scripting ##

Hangfire.Scripting lets you run CScharp scripts with Roslyn using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting nuget package. 
This hangfire extension uses a modified version of the https://github.com/pjrharley/Hangfire.Core.Dashboard.Management extension to enable scheduling and manual execution of your scripts.
